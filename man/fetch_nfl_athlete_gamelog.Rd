\item "both" - Both game-by-game and summary data
}}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON response to global environment
as 'nfl_athlete_gamelog_raw' for debugging purposes (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the processed data. The main purpose is global
environment assignment:
\itemize{
\item \code{nfl_athlete_gamelog} - Game-by-game data frame (if return_type includes "games")
\item \code{nfl_athlete_season_summary} - Season summary data frame (if return_type includes "summary")

\description{
Retrieves detailed game-by-game statistics for NFL players from ESPN's API.
The function fetches data from ESPN's Web API and processes it into a
structured data frame containing game details, opponent information, and
statistical performance for each game.
}
\details{
The function creates structured data frames with the following columns:

Game log data frame columns:
\itemize{
\item athlete_id, season_year, season_type, event_id
\item game_date, week, opponent information
\item home_away, game_result, scores
\item stat_category, stat_name, stat_value, etc.
}

The function handles both passing and rushing statistics, automatically
categorizing them based on the ESPN API response structure.
