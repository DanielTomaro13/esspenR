\usage{
fetch_multiple_soccer_teams(
  league_slugs,
  return_type = "all",
  delay = 0.5,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{league_slugs}{Character vector. ESPN league slugs.
Examples: c("eng.1", "esp.1", "ger.1") for Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga.}

\item{return_type}{Character. Type of data to return (default: "all").
Same options as \code{\link{fetch_soccer_teams}}.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.5).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first league only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frames. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined datasets from all leagues.
}
\description{
Retrieves team information for multiple soccer leagues with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_soccer_teams}}
for each league and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes leagues sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual leagues are logged but
do not stop the overall process. The final datasets contain data from
all successfully processed leagues.
}

\dontrun{
# Get teams for major European leagues
major_leagues <- c("eng.1", "esp.1", "ger.1", "ita.1", "fra.1")
fetch_multiple_soccer_teams(major_leagues)

# Get teams only
fetch_multiple_soccer_teams(major_leagues, return_type = "teams")

# Use longer delay for larger requests
fetch_multiple_soccer_teams(major_leagues, delay = 1.0)

# Analyze combined results
unique_leagues <- unique(soccer_teams$league_slug)
cat("Retrieved teams for", length(unique_leagues), "leagues\n")

# Find all teams named "United"
united_teams <- soccer_teams[
  grepl("United", soccer_teams$team_name),
]

# Compare stadium capacities across leagues
stadiums <- soccer_teams[
  !is.na(soccer_teams$venue_capacity) &
  soccer_teams$venue_capacity != "",
]
stadiums$capacity_num <- as.numeric(stadiums$venue_capacity)
largest_stadiums <- stadiums[order(-stadiums$capacity_num), ]

# Analyze team colors across leagues
team_colors <- soccer_teams[
  !is.na(soccer_teams$team_color),
  c("league_slug", "team_display_name", "team_color")
]
