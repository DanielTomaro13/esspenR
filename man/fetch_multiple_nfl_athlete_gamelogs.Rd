\title{Fetch multiple NFL athletes' game log data}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_gamelogs(
  athlete_ids,
  season = NULL,
  season_type = "all",
  return_type = "games",
  delay = 0.1,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{athlete_ids}{Character or Numeric vector. ESPN athlete IDs.
Vector of unique identifiers for athletes in ESPN's database.}

\item{season}{Character or Numeric. Season year (optional).
If not provided, fetches current/latest season for all athletes.}

\item{season_type}{Character. Season type to fetch (default: "all").
Same options as \code{\link{fetch_nfl_athlete_gamelog}}.}

\item{return_type}{Character. Type of data to return (default: "games").
Same options as \code{\link{fetch_nfl_athlete_gamelog}}.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.1).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first athlete only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined datasets from all athletes:
\itemize{
\item \code{nfl_athlete_gamelog} - Combined game-by-game data
\item \code{nfl_athlete_season_summary} - Combined season summary data
}
}
\description{
Retrieves game log data for multiple NFL athletes with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_nfl_athlete_gamelog}}
for each athlete and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes athletes sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual athletes are logged but
do not stop the overall process. Duplicate records are automatically
removed from the final combined dataset.

\dontrun{
# Get game logs for multiple quarterbacks
qb_ids <- c("3918298", "3139477", "4035671")  # Allen, Mahomes, Burrow
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_gamelogs(qb_ids)

# Get specific season for multiple players
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_gamelogs(qb_ids, season = "2024")

# Get season summaries for multiple players
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_gamelogs(qb_ids, return_type = "summary")

# Use longer delay for larger requests
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_gamelogs(qb_ids, delay = 0.5)
