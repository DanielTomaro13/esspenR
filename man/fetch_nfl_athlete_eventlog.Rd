\title{Fetch NFL athlete event log data using Core API}
\usage{
fetch_nfl_athlete_eventlog(
  athlete_id,
  season,
  fetch_details = FALSE,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{athlete_id}{Character or Numeric. ESPN athlete ID (required).
The unique identifier for the athlete in ESPN's database.}

\item{season}{Character or Numeric. Season year (required).
The season for which to fetch event log data. Format: "2024" or 2024.}

\item{fetch_details}{Logical. Whether to fetch detailed event information
by following reference URLs (default: FALSE). Setting to TRUE will make
additional API calls for each event to get comprehensive data.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON response to global environment
as 'nfl_athlete_eventlog_raw' for debugging purposes (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the processed data frame. The main purpose is global
environment assignment:
\itemize{
\item \code{nfl_athlete_eventlog} - Event log data frame
\item \code{nfl_athlete_eventlog_raw} - Raw JSON response (if raw = TRUE)
}
}
\description{
Retrieves event log data for NFL players from ESPN's Core API.
The function fetches event reference data and optionally retrieves
detailed information by following the reference URLs.
}
\details{
The ESPN Core API returns reference URLs rather than complete data. This function
can operate in two modes:

\strong{Basic Mode (fetch_details = FALSE):}
\itemize{
\item Fast execution with minimal API calls
\item Returns event IDs, reference URLs, team info, and played status
\item Suitable for getting event lists and basic information
}

\strong{Detailed Mode (fetch_details = TRUE):}
\itemize{
\item Makes additional API calls to fetch complete event details
\item Returns comprehensive event, competition, and venue information
\item Much slower but provides complete data
\item Use with caution due to rate limiting
}

Data frame columns include:
\itemize{
\item athlete_id, season_year, team_id, event_id
\item event_ref, competition_ref, statistics_ref (API reference URLs)
\item played (boolean indicating if event was played)
\item Detailed fields (when fetch_details = TRUE): event_name, event_date,
week_number, season_type, venue_name, opponent information
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get basic event log (fast, minimal API calls)
fetch_nfl_athlete_eventlog(athlete_id = "3918298", season = "2024")
head(nfl_athlete_eventlog)

# Get detailed event log (slow, many API calls)
fetch_nfl_athlete_eventlog(athlete_id = "3918298", season = "2024",
                           fetch_details = TRUE)

# Check reference URLs for manual API calls
refs <- nfl_athlete_eventlog[c("event_ref", "competition_ref", "statistics_ref")]
head(refs)

# Get raw data for debugging
fetch_nfl_athlete_eventlog(athlete_id = "3918298", season = "2024", raw = TRUE)
str(nfl_athlete_eventlog_raw)
}
