\title{Fetch college football rankings for multiple weeks}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_cfb_rankings(
  weeks,
  year = as.integer(format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y")),
  season_type = 2,
  poll = "all",
  delay = 0.5,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weeks}{Integer vector. Week numbers to fetch rankings for.}

\item{year}{Integer. Season year to fetch (default: current year).}

\item{season_type}{Integer. Season type (default: 2 for regular season).}

\item{poll}{Character. Specific poll to fetch (default: "all").}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.5).}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first week only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frame. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined \code{cfb_rankings} from all weeks.
}
\description{

This function calls \code{\link{fetch_college_football_rankings}} for each week
