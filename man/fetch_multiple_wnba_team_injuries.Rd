\title{Fetch multiple wnba team injuries data}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_wnba_team_injuries(team_ids, delay = 0.3, raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{team_ids}{Character or Numeric vector. ESPN wnba team IDs.
Vector of unique identifiers for teams in ESPN's database.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.3).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first team only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined injury data frame. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined injury data from all teams.
}
\description{
Retrieves injury information for multiple wnba teams with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's Core API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_wnba_team_injuries}}
for each team and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes teams sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual teams are logged but
do not stop the overall process. The final dataset contains injury data from
all successfully processed teams.

This is particularly useful for league-wide injury analysis,
fantasy basketball research, or medical staff benchmarking studies.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get injuries for multiple teams
east_teams <- c("1", "2", "17")  # Hawks, Celtics, Nets
fetch_multiple_wnba_team_injuries(east_teams)

# Use longer delay for larger requests
all_teams <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
fetch_multiple_wnba_team_injuries(all_teams, delay = 0.5)

# Analyze combined results
unique_teams <- unique(wnba_team_injuries$request_team_id)
cat("Retrieved injury data for", length(unique_teams), "teams\n")

# League-wide injury analysis
injury_summary <- table(wnba_team_injuries$injury_type_name)
print(injury_summary)

# Teams with most injuries
team_injury_counts <- table(wnba_team_injuries$request_team_id)
print(sort(team_injury_counts, decreasing = TRUE))
