\title{Fetch soccer news for multiple leagues}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_soccer_news(leagues, limit = 25, delay = 0.5, raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{leagues}{Character vector. League slugs to fetch news for.
Examples: c("eng.1", "esp.1", "ger.1") for Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga.}

\item{limit}{Integer. Maximum number of articles per league (default: 25).}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.5).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first league only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frame. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined \code{soccer_news} from all leagues.
}
\description{
Retrieves league-specific news for multiple soccer leagues with rate limiting.
This function calls \code{\link{fetch_soccer_news}} for each league
and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes leagues sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual leagues are logged but
do not stop the overall process. The final dataset contains news data from
all successfully processed leagues.

This is particularly useful for multi-league news analysis,
content aggregation, or monitoring multiple competitions simultaneously.

\dontrun{
# Get news for major European leagues
major_leagues <- c("eng.1", "esp.1", "ger.1", "ita.1", "fra.1")
fetch_multiple_soccer_news(major_leagues)

# Get news for specific leagues with fewer articles each
fetch_multiple_soccer_news(c("eng.1", "usa.1", "mex.1"), limit = 15)

# Use longer delay for larger requests
fetch_multiple_soccer_news(major_leagues, delay = 1.0)

# Check combined results
head(soccer_news)
table(soccer_news$league)

# Find transfer window coverage across leagues
transfer_news <- soccer_news[
  grepl("transfer|signing|window", soccer_news$headline, ignore.case = TRUE),
  c("league", "headline", "published")
]
print(transfer_news)

# Compare news volume by league
league_counts <- table(soccer_news$league)
print(league_counts)
