environment assignment based on return_type:
\itemize{
\item \code{nfl_boxscore_game_info} - Game information data frame
\item \code{nfl_boxscore_team_stats} - Team statistics data frame
\item \code{nfl_boxscore_player_stats} - Player statistics data frame
\item \code{nfl_boxscore_raw} - Raw JSON response (if raw = TRUE)

\description{
Retrieves detailed boxscore information from ESPN's CDN API.
The function fetches comprehensive team and player statistics
for a specific NFL game.
}
\details{
The function creates structured data frames with comprehensive boxscore information:

\strong{Game Information} (\code{nfl_boxscore_game_info}):
\itemize{
\item Game details: event_id, game_date, game_status, season info
\item Team matchup: home_team vs away_team with final scores
}

\strong{Team Statistics} (\code{nfl_boxscore_team_stats}):
\itemize{
\item Team-level statistics by category (passing, rushing, defense, etc.)
\item Both home and away team stats in same data frame
\item Individual stat names, values, and display values
}

\strong{Player Statistics} (\code{nfl_boxscore_player_stats}):
\itemize{
\item Individual player performance by statistical category
\item Player identification: name, position, jersey number
\item Detailed statistics for passing, rushing, receiving, defense, etc.
}

This provides the most detailed statistical breakdown available,
including individual player performance data that's valuable for
fantasy sports, player analysis, and comprehensive game evaluation.
