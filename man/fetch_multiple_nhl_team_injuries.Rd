\title{Fetch multiple NHL team injuries data}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_nhl_team_injuries(team_ids, delay = 0.3, raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{team_ids}{Character or Numeric vector. ESPN NHL team IDs.
Vector of unique identifiers for teams in ESPN's database.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.3).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first team only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined injury data frame. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined injury data from all teams.
}
\description{
Retrieves injury information for multiple NHL teams with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's Core API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_nhl_team_injuries}}
for each team and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes teams sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual teams are logged but
do not stop the overall process. The final dataset contains injury data from
all successfully processed teams.

This is particularly useful for league-wide injury analysis,
fantasy hockey research, or medical staff benchmarking studies.

# Get injuries for multiple teams
original_six <- c("4", "3", "8", "10", "16", "17")  # Bruins, Rangers, Canadiens, Maple Leafs, Blackhawks, Red Wings
fetch_multiple_nhl_team_injuries(original_six)

# Use longer delay for larger requests
eastern_conference <- c("4", "7", "12", "13", "1", "2", "5", "9")
fetch_multiple_nhl_team_injuries(eastern_conference, delay = 0.5)

# Teams with most injuries
