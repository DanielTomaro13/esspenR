\title{Fetch multiple NFL leaders data across years and season types}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_nfl_leaders(
  years = 2024,
  season_types = c(2),
  return_type = "all",
  fetch_athlete_info = TRUE,
  athlete_delay = 0.1,
  delay = 0.2,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{Character or Numeric vector. Season years to fetch (default: 2024).
Vector of years for the NFL seasons to retrieve leaders for.}

\item{season_types}{Numeric vector. Season types to fetch (default: c(2)).
Vector of season type identifiers (1=Preseason, 2=Regular, 3=Postseason).}

\item{return_type}{Character. Type of data to return (default: "all").
Same options as \code{\link{fetch_nfl_leaders}}.}

\item{fetch_athlete_info}{Logical. Whether to fetch detailed athlete info
from reference URLs (default: TRUE). This makes many additional API calls.}

\item{athlete_delay}{Numeric. Delay between athlete API requests in seconds
(default: 0.1). Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between main API requests (default: 0.2).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first combination only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frames. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined datasets from all combinations.
}
\description{
Retrieves leaders data for multiple years and season types with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's Core API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_nfl_leaders}}
for each combination and combines the results.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get leaders for last 2 regular seasons with athlete details
fetch_multiple_nfl_leaders(years = c(2023, 2024), season_types = c(2))

# Get leaders without athlete details (much faster)
fetch_multiple_nfl_leaders(years = c(2022, 2023, 2024),
                          fetch_athlete_info = FALSE)

# Get leaders with more conservative API usage
fetch_multiple_nfl_leaders(years = c(2023, 2024),
                          athlete_delay = 0.2, delay = 0.5)
