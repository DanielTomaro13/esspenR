\strong{Game Summary} (\code{wnba_pbp_game_summary}):
\itemize{
\item Game details: event_id, game_date, game_status, season info
\item Team matchup: home_team vs away_team with final scores
\item Venue and total plays information
}

\strong{Period Summary} (\code{wnba_pbp_period_summary}):
\itemize{
\item Period-by-period scoring breakdown
\item Play counts per period
\item Running score after each period
}

\strong{Plays} (\code{wnba_pbp_plays}):
\itemize{
