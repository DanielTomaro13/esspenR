\title{Fetch multiple NFL athletes' event log data}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_eventlogs(
  athlete_ids,
  season,
  fetch_details = FALSE,
  delay = 0.3,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{athlete_ids}{Character or Numeric vector. ESPN athlete IDs.
Vector of unique identifiers for athletes in ESPN's database.}

\item{season}{Character or Numeric. Season year (required).
The season for which to fetch event log data for all athletes.}

\item{fetch_details}{Logical. Whether to fetch detailed event information
(default: FALSE). Use with caution as this significantly increases API calls.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.3).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers. Increase for detailed mode.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first athlete only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frame. The main purpose is global
environment assignment:
\itemize{
\item \code{nfl_athlete_eventlog} - Combined event log data from all athletes
}
}
\description{
Retrieves event log data for multiple NFL athletes with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's Core API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_nfl_athlete_eventlog}}
for each athlete and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes athletes sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. When fetch_details = TRUE, the function will make many
additional API calls (2+ per event per athlete), so use with caution.

Consider using longer delays and smaller athlete batches when fetch_details = TRUE
to avoid hitting ESPN's rate limits.

# Get basic event logs for multiple quarterbacks (fast)
qb_ids <- c("3918298", "3139477", "4035671")  # Allen, Mahomes, Burrow
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_eventlogs(qb_ids, season = "2024")

# Get detailed event logs (slow, many API calls)
fetch_multiple_nfl_athlete_eventlogs(qb_ids, season = "2024",
                                     fetch_details = TRUE, delay = 1.0)

# Process smaller batches with details
