\title{Fetch multiple MLB player statistics}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_mlb_player_stats(player_ids, delay = 0.5, raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{player_ids}{Character or Numeric vector. ESPN MLB player IDs.
Vector of unique identifiers for players in ESPN's database.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.5).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first player only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frames. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined datasets from all players.
}
\description{
Retrieves statistics for multiple MLB players with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_mlb_player_stats}}
for each player and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes players sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual players are logged but
do not stop the overall process. The final datasets contain data from
all successfully processed players.

This is particularly useful for team analysis, comparing multiple players,
or building comprehensive baseball databases.

\dontrun{
# Get stats for multiple players
player_ids <- c("30951", "33712", "41169")  # Harper, Schwarber, Bohm
fetch_multiple_mlb_player_stats(player_ids)

# Use longer delay for larger requests
fetch_multiple_mlb_player_stats(player_ids, delay = 1.0)

# Analyze combined results
unique_players <- unique(mlb_player_season_summary$player_display_name)
cat("Retrieved statistics for", length(unique_players), "players\n")

# Compare batting averages
batting_comparison <- mlb_player_season_summary[
  mlb_player_season_summary$stat_category == "batting" &
  mlb_player_season_summary$stat_type == "avg",
  c("player_display_name", "avg", "home_runs", "rbi", "ops")
