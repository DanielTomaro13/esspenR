\title{Fetch multiple college_baseball game play-by-play data}
\usage{
fetch_multiple_college_baseball_game_playbyplay(
  event_ids,
  return_type = "all",
  delay = 0.3,
  raw = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{event_ids}{Character or Numeric vector. ESPN event IDs.
Vector of unique identifiers for games in ESPN's database.}

\item{return_type}{Character. Type of data to return (default: "all").
Same options as \code{\link{fetch_college_baseball_game_playbyplay}}.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. Delay in seconds between API requests (default: 0.3).
Used to be respectful to ESPN's servers and avoid rate limiting.}

\item{raw}{Logical. If TRUE, assigns raw JSON to global environment
for the first game only (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frames. The main purpose is global
environment assignment of combined datasets from all games.
}
\description{
Retrieves play-by-play data for multiple college_baseball games with rate limiting to
be respectful to ESPN's API. This function calls \code{\link{fetch_college_baseball_game_playbyplay}}
for each game and combines the results.
}
\details{
The function processes games sequentially with a configurable delay
between requests. Failed requests for individual games are logged but
do not stop the overall process. The final datasets contain data from
all successfully processed games.

This is particularly useful for building comprehensive baseball databases,
analyzing pitching strategies across multiple games, studying hitting
patterns over time, or conducting advanced sabermetric research.
